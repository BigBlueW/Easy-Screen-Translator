# Usage
To use this program directly, you should...

First, unzip the EST.zip (I had to do it, because it had exceed the 100mb limit of github) to the same directory.

Next, click the EST.exe. 

After opened, the program allows you to press Win+Shift+L to make a screenshot 

(you must confirm that Win+Shift+S is working as universal windows computer.)

Select the area you wanna translate. 

And it will popup a notification showing the result of translator.

(It will also copy the result into you clipboard)

BTW, since EST.exe has no window shown, I make a close.bat that can turn off this program.

# Customize
You are allowed to change

1. language you wanna translate to 
2. key to do the screen translate

via modifying the config.txt.

> resultLanguage = zh-TW
key = win+shift+l

Default language is in config.txt. (worked even if config.txt is deleted)

Language list is provided in language_list.txt.

(Notice: Not all languages are supported.)
